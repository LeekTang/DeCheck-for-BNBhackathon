It is just a matter of how to make decisions on different projects with different technical points in different areas. arbitrum was often contrasted with optimism (op) and zksync.At that time, zksync2.0 had not been put on the line yet, and there was a lot of uncertainty about it, but its leading technology was beyond doubt, so we put zkrollup on hold for a while and compared it with op. If not to pick out the details, in general, arbitrum and op have one difference. Is that op at that time can only do 99% compatible with EVM, it does its own EVM execution level some instruction set is not enough support, but arbitrum is the first to do 100% compatible with EVM, Although it may seem a difference of 1%, but compared with op and arbitrum, arbitrum has a very big difference in the rapid roll-out of the market execution level. By the end of '21, there was some money available to try out some local dog projects on arbitrum. And then there were some good projects, like GMX, or some derivatives, because this kind of financial derivative is naturally suitable for layer2 to do.
